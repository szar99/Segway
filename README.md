# Segway

## Project plan

Project is devided into three main stages. 
- First stage contains of small simple differential robot project that will use Pixy camera for navigation and two motors that, with the help of speed differentiation, will allow you to move in the right direction.
- Second stage consists of a segway design that can independently maintain balance and move in the desired direction.
- The third stage involves combining the two previous concepts and designing a segway that will use a camera to navigate and track the object.

### Stage 1 - differential robot

Milestones:
- Pixy-Cam driver
- Hardware 
- CAD design
- Building
- Software

### Stage 2 - simple segway

### Stage 3 - segway with pixy cam
